  <h2>üé§ Expert++ Interview Practice: Hover to Reveal</h2>
  <div id="interview">
    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Let‚Äôs start with something simple ‚Äî can you tell us a bit about yourself?</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Thank you for having me. My name is Jonathan Joaqu√≠n Landa Medrano, and I‚Äôm a senior at Saco Oliveros School in Lima. I‚Äôve consistently ranked in the top 10% of my class and earned national recognition in mathematics competitions. I‚Äôm passionate about Mechatronic Engineering because it blends logic, creativity, and real-world problem solving ‚Äî and I‚Äôve been preparing for this path through academic acceleration, programming, and hands-on projects.</div></div>

    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What inspired you to pursue this field?</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> It started with my fascination for how things work ‚Äî from mechanical systems to algorithms. When I competed in the III Young Mathematicians Tournament and scored 90/100, I realized how much I enjoy solving complex problems. That led me to explore robotics and automation, and I‚Äôve been drawn to Mechatronics ever since. It‚Äôs a field where I can build, optimize, and innovate.</div></div>

    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Tell us about a challenge you‚Äôve faced and how you overcame it.</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Preparing for university entrance exams while managing personal responsibilities was a major challenge. I created a disciplined study routine, often waking early to review materials and simulate mock exams. I also supported elderly neighbors in my community during the pandemic, which taught me time management and empathy. Balancing both helped me grow academically and personally.</div></div>

    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What achievement are you most proud of?</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> I‚Äôm proud of earning a Gold Medal in the EDUMATT Olympiad and qualifying for Phase 2 of ONEM XXI with a score of 90/100. These reflect years of preparation and a deep love for mathematics. I‚Äôm also proud of co-founding my school‚Äôs chess club ‚Äî organizing tournaments and mentoring younger players helped me develop leadership and strategic thinking.</div></div>

    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Why are you applying for this scholarship?</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> This scholarship would allow me to pursue higher education without placing a financial burden on my family. I‚Äôm currently part of the Beca Cometa program, which prepares students for U.S. university applications, and I see this scholarship as a bridge to opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and represent Peru with pride.</div></div>

    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How do you plan to use your education to make a difference?</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> I want to apply Mechatronic Engineering to solve infrastructure and automation challenges in Latin America. Whether it‚Äôs designing efficient systems or developing accessible technologies, I believe my education can help improve quality of life and drive innovation in underserved areas.</div></div>

    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What would giving back to your community look like for you?</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> In that sense, I would love to organize robotics or basic technology workshops for students, especially in areas where they don‚Äôt have easy access to these tools. I think showing them that science and innovation can be something close and accessible could motivate them to dream big and believe that they can also have a future in these fields.

I also want to contribute by being an example: showing that with effort, perseverance, and commitment it is possible to take advantage of the opportunities that come along. I would like to be a bridge between what I learn abroad and what my community needs, whether by sharing knowledge, supporting educational projects, or even developing initiatives that could have a direct social impact.

In short, I believe I could help not only by coming back with a degree, but with the genuine intention of sharing what I have learned and opening doors so that others also have the chance to grow.</div></div>

    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Where do you see yourself in five years?</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> I see myself studying Mechatronic Engineering at a top university, contributing to research in robotics and intelligent systems, and collaborating internationally ‚Äî I‚Äôve even started learning Mandarin to expand my global perspective. I hope to be involved in projects that blend engineering with social impact.</div></div>

    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Why should we give the scholarship to you and not another person?</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> I believe I bring a unique combination of academic excellence, personal resilience, and a deep commitment to social impact. My achievements reflect not just talent, but discipline and perseverance in the face of challenges. I‚Äôve consistently sought ways to uplift others ‚Äî through mentoring, community support, and leadership ‚Äî and I see this scholarship not just as a personal opportunity, but as a responsibility to give back.

I‚Äôm not asking to be chosen because I‚Äôm better than someone else, but because I‚Äôm ready to make the most of this opportunity and turn it into something bigger than myself. I want to represent my country, inspire others, and build bridges between knowledge and action. If given the chance, I will carry this scholarship with pride, purpose, and a promise to pay it forward.</div></div>

    <div class="exchange"><div class="interviewer"><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Is there anything else you‚Äôd like us to know?</div></div>
    <div class="exchange"><div class="jonathan"><strong>Jonathan:</strong> Yes ‚Äî I‚Äôd like you to know that everything I‚Äôve achieved has come from effort, not shortcuts. When I was promoted a grade ahead, I had to prove I belonged. When I balanced academics with family responsibilities, I learned resilience. And when I couldn‚Äôt find a space to lead, I created one through my school‚Äôs chess club. These experiences shaped how I approach challenges ‚Äî with discipline, initiative, and purpose. Every early morning study session, every competition, every setback ‚Äî I‚Äôve treated them as steps toward something bigger. This scholarship isn‚Äôt just a goal; it‚Äôs the next chapter in a
