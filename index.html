Interviewer: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Letâ€™s start with something simple â€” can you tell us a bit about yourself?

Jonathan: Thank you for having me. My name is Jonathan JoaquÃ­n Landa Medrano, and Iâ€™m a senior at Saco Oliveros School in Lima. Iâ€™ve consistently ranked in the top 10% of my class and earned national recognition in mathematics competitions. Iâ€™m passionate about Mechatronic Engineering because it blends logic, creativity, and real-world problem solving â€” and Iâ€™ve been preparing for this path through academic acceleration, programming, and hands-on projects.

Interviewer: What inspired you to pursue this field?

Jonathan: It started with my fascination for how things work â€” from mechanical systems to algorithms. When I competed in the III Young Mathematicians Tournament and scored 90/100, I realized how much I enjoy solving complex problems. That led me to explore robotics and automation, and Iâ€™ve been drawn to Mechatronics ever since. Itâ€™s a field where I can build, optimize, and innovate.

Interviewer: Tell us about a challenge youâ€™ve faced and how you overcame it.

Jonathan: Preparing for university entrance exams while managing personal responsibilities was a major challenge. I created a disciplined study routine, often waking early to review materials and simulate mock exams. I also supported elderly neighbors in my community during the pandemic, which taught me time management and empathy. Balancing both helped me grow academically and personally.

Interviewer: What achievement are you most proud of?

Jonathan: Iâ€™m proud of earning a Gold Medal in the EDUMATT Olympiad and qualifying for Phase 2 of ONEM XXI with a score of 90/100. These reflect years of preparation and a deep love for mathematics. Iâ€™m also proud of co-founding my schoolâ€™s chess club â€” organizing tournaments and mentoring younger players helped me develop leadership and strategic thinking.

Interviewer: Why are you applying for this scholarship?

Jonathan: This scholarship would allow me to pursue higher education without placing a financial burden on my family. Iâ€™m currently part of the Beca Cometa program, which prepares students for U.S. university applications, and I see this scholarship as a bridge to opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and represent Peru with pride.

Interviewer: How do you plan to use your education to make a difference?

Jonathan: I want to apply Mechatronic Engineering to solve infrastructure and automation challenges in Latin America. Whether itâ€™s designing efficient systems or developing accessible technologies, I believe my education can help improve quality of life and drive innovation in underserved areas.

Interviewer: Where do you see yourself in five years?

Jonathan: I see myself studying Mechatronic Engineering at a top university, contributing to research in robotics and intelligent systems, and collaborating internationally â€” Iâ€™ve even started learning Mandarin to expand my global perspective. I hope to be involved in projects that blend engineering with social impact.

Interviewer: Is there anything else youâ€™d like us to know?

Jonathan: Yes â€” Iâ€™d like you to know that everything Iâ€™ve achieved has come from effort, not shortcuts. When I was promoted a grade ahead, I had to prove I belonged. When I balanced academics with family responsibilities, I learned resilience. And when I couldnâ€™t find a space to lead, I created one through my schoolâ€™s chess club. These experiences shaped how I approach challenges â€” with discipline, initiative, and purpose. Every early morning study session, every competition, every setback â€” Iâ€™ve treated them as steps toward something bigger. This scholarship isnâ€™t just a goal; itâ€™s the next chapter in a journey Iâ€™ve been writing with conviction. Iâ€™m ready to carry it forward.
